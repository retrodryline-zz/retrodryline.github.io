Why retrodryline?
GitHub allows a free hosted <a href="https://pages.github.com/ " target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">website</a> addressed at [GitHub Username]/githib.io

My GitHub username is @retrodryline and retrodryline is short for retrograding drlyine, inspired during my time at Texas Tech University (Lubbock, TX) when I created my GitHub account.

A retrograding dryline is a meteorological process in which a dryline propagates back westward (northern hemisphere). A dryline is a boundary between two airmasses of different water vapor (moisture). A retrograding dryline is most notably observed in west Texas during the evening and overnight hours during the spring season. During the daytime hours the dryline boundary tends to propagate eastward due to differential heating of airmasses.
