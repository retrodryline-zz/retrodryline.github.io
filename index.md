Welcome to my website showcasing current and past work related to data science and meteorology. I am a meteorologist by design and a data scientist by curiousity. My passion for weather started around age 6 in Wisconsin watching winter and summer materialize, or sometimes not. This desire to better understand and predict the weather only grew through time and motivated me through my undergraduate and graduate studies. My curiousity to understand, find, and explain phenomena in data beyond meteorology has grown in recent years my a motivation to help others make better informed, data-driven decisions. If you're interested in collaborating on a data proejct or have a work opportunity, lets talk.
