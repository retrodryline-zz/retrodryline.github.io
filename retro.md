retrodryline is short for retrograding drlyine

A retrograding dryline is a meteorological process in which a dryline propagates back westward (northern hemisphere). A dryline is a boundary between two airmasses of different water vapor (moisture). A retrograding dryline is most notably observed in west Texas during the evening and overnight hours during the spring season. During the daytime hours the dryline boundary tends to propagate eastward due to differential heating of airmasses.
